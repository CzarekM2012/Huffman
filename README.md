# Huffman

### Objective

The main objective of this project is implementation of the Huffman coding algorithm in its base and adaptive forms and comparison of their effectiveness in encoding natural images.

### Effectiveness metrics

**Compression rate** - ratio between the size of data before and after compression  
**Bit rate** - average number of bits in the compressed form of data used to encode an element of the original representation  
**Entropy** - average number of information units per element of data, theoretical limit of data compression, effectiveness of compression can by determined by comparing bit rate and entropy  
**Encoding time** - amount of time required to create encoded representation of data  

### Dependencies
 - Python 3.12
 - modules listed in `requirements.txt`
